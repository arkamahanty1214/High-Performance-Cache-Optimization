## High-Performance Cache Optimization (C++)

## What's This?
A C++ simulator for CPU-GPU cache coherence with adaptive prefetching. Cuts down cache misses and speeds up data transfer.ðŸš€

## Highlights
- 15% fewer cache misses
- 12% faster data transfer

## Features
- Simulates CPU-GPU cache coherence protocols
- Adaptive prefetching (smarter cache, happier CPU)
- Output clear performance metrics.

## Note
No live demo link - since it's all C++ and runs in the terminal.
